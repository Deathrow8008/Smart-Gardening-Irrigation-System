# Smart-Gardening-Irrigation-System
Automation can be described as the technology of which a procedure or process is executed or performed without human intervention or assistance. The main objective of this project is to determine how the irrigation process can be automated in ensuring water management and efficiency. An automatic irrigation system based on sensor-based systems and time-based which will be designed and implemented as one of the most widely used and advantageous automatic system. This system uses a soil moisture sensor technology together with the micro controller, a peristaltic pump and a Bluetooth module
